# One Boss, One Room, One Shot

Controls - Mouse to aim, WSAD for movement, left click to shoot and space to shoot.  

Made with Godot.  

Our idea was to have a one boss you fight with a gun with one gun that can only hold one charge, in one room.The one boss evolves, so you have to use all five of the elements (earth, fire, water, electricity, and air), to defeat him. But every time you defeat the boss, he evolves.  We went a bit to large on scale for our first jam so there are some buggy behaviors and we didn't have time to implement all ideas had.  

Things we didn't have time to implement :  The boss behaviour has some bugs, and is a bit unfair some places, requires more playtesting and balancing.  Elements can be mixed together to create new charges and add more phases.  The boss could be more formidable and have more variety based on his phase.  The world could be a bit bigger and more systemic uses for the special characteristics of elemental projectiles could be implemented into the map.
